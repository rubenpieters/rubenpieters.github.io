title: Choosing between nub and ordNub? In Scala you don't have to!

Haskell's `Data.List` module contains [`nub`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Data-List.html#v:nub), a function which removes duplicate elements from a list.
However, it doesn't have very good performance.
The culprit is the `Eq` constraint, limiting the function to comparing elements for equality.
There is an improved version called [`ordNub`](https://github.com/nh2/haskell-ordnub), but it requires an `Ord` constraint.

The interesting point I want to highlight in this post doesn't have much to do with this specific use case. It's probably quite rare that you specifically need `nub` where `ordNub` wouldn't work.
What I do want to highlight is that if this situation ever arose in Scala, we would be able to use [implicit prioritization](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1887678) to avoid having to choose at all.

# Approach

We are going to create a typeclass containing the function signature for `nub`.
By using implicit prioritization we can prefer the instance which uses `Ord` over the one with `Eq`, this is done by putting the `Ord`-based instance in a subclass.
This was explained in the stackoverflow post:

```scala
trait LowPriorityImplicits {
  //lower priority conversions
}

object HighPriorityImplicits extends LowPriorityImplicits {
  //higher-order ones here
}
```

# Implementation

First we set up the `Eq` and `Ord` typeclasses so we can control the available implicit values for them.
We're not actually going to implement any deduplicator functions here, so let's just make them return a cool `String`.

```scala
trait Eq[A] {
  def eq: String
}
trait Ord[A] {
  val ord: String
}
```

Let's give `Int` an `Eq` and `Ord` instance, but only give `String` an `Eq` instance.
So, when we `nub` a list of `Int`s it should use the `Ord` version while for a list of `String`s it should use the `Eq` version.

```scala
implicit val eqInt: Eq[Int]
 = new Eq[Int] { val eq = "My name is Eq Int." }
implicit val ordInt: Ord[Int]
 = new Ord[Int] { val ord = "Hi! I'm Ord Int." }

implicit val eqString: Eq[String]
 = new Eq[String] { val eq = "Hello there, I am known as Eq String." }
```

We set up another typeclass called `Nubbable`.
We prioritize the creation of instances for this typeclass with a simple rule: prefer the `Ord`-based over the `Eq`-based one.
We can do this by putting the `Ord`-based instance in a subclass of where the `Eq`-based instance is located.
For example:

```scala
trait Nubbable[A] {
  def nubbed(l: List[A]): String
}

trait LowPrio {
  implicit def eqNub[A](implicit ev: Eq[A]): Nubbable[A]
    = new Nubbable[A] {
      def nubbed(l: List[A]) = "Message from nubber: " + ev.eq
    }
}

object HighPrio extends LowPrio {
  implicit def ordNub[A](implicit ev: Ord[A]): Nubbable[A]
    = new Nubbable[A] {
      def nubbed(l: List[A]) = "Message from nubber: " + ev.ord
    }
}
```

Now, when we create our `nub` function by taking `Nubbable` as an implicit parameter and run it on some examples we get our expected output.
The `Ord` instance responds for `Int`, while the `Eq` instance responds for `String`.

```scala
import HighPrio._

def nub[A](l: List[A])(implicit ev: Nubbable[A]): String
 = ev.nubbed(l)

println(nub(List(1,2,3)))
// Message from nubber: Hi! I'm Ord Int.
println(nub(List("a","b","c")))
// Message from nubber: Hello there, I am known as Eq String.
```
 
# Conclusion
 
I think this is a cool showcase of maybe a lesser known feature, used by [some](https://github.com/milessabin/kittens/blob/53259ebca7f98d142a30eda48a3ae0a01668de54/core/src/main/scala/cats/derived/consk.scala#L39) [Scala](https://github.com/circe/circe/blob/1efc2877f113c0b5ea9d9525c293c5d3db7e8389/modules/generic/shared/src/main/scala/io/circe/generic/decoding/DerivedDecoder.scala) [libraries](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/blob/8511884030ac061c6ab01940b188fcab53aff151/core/src/main/scala/shapeless/poly.scala#L146).
I also find it interesting that I could easily solve this problem in Scala, while I wouldn't know how to solve it in a same fashion in Haskell (if it is even possible).
You can find the code for this example [here](https://scalafiddle.io/sf/ygAxm5B/0).
